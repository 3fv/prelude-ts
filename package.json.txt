Comments for the package.json cause I can't put them in the file itself...

   "@types/node": "9.6.7"
   => pin the types/node dependency for a more reliable build
      example https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/25342
      @types/node is a transitive dep from typedoc, typedoc doesn't lock it

   the typescript dependency is at 3.1.x because that's the oldest TS version
   that we support. You can also build with the TS version of your choice by
   running 'tsc' manually.

   we are modifying the generated typedoc HTML to improve it, hence did not
   upgrade typedoc for a while.


Direct handlebars dependency:
https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/1159

Need to pin handlebars to unbreak typedoc
